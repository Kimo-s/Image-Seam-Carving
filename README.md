# Image-Seam-Carving

Seam carving is a content aware algorithm for resizing the image based on the energy function. Typically the energy function is decided by the sobel opreater which emphasis the importance of each pixel based on the edges.

The program allows for visualization of the path that will be deleted from the image using the GUI from imgui.
